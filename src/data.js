      "I will be very straightforward - I hate sports and working out. <strong>Positive Yoga</strong> put my physical activity to the next level. I started to enjoy my morning yoga routines where I get my dose of cardio, resistance, and stretching in one place. I could barely hold a plank at the beginning. Now I’m doing various yoga poses that looked impossible at first. My body shape improved a lot and I am very motivated by both: results and the feeling of progress.",

Also, I’ve learned about yoga philosophy and poses that encourage me to practice mindfulness and pay attention to stress reduction. I am very proud of myself. Feeling better is my biggest motivation.",
